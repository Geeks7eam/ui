  ## Name of The Library

  We are excited to announce a significant transformation as our library evolves from `@geeks/ui` to the more dynamic and modular `@zyxui`. This strategic shift signifies a paradigm change in component integration, granting you unprecedented control over your projects.

  ## Core Changes:

  - Performance Excellence
    Experience a performance boost as each component is optimized to deliver swift and efficient functionality, ensuring a seamless user experience.
  - Reduced Dependencies
    Bid farewell to unnecessary bloat. `@zyxui` is designed to minimize dependencies, allowing you to maintain a lean and efficient codebase.
